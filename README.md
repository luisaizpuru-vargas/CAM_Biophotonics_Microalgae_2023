# CAM_Biophotonics_Microalgae_2023
This is a repository of the raw CAM images used for analysis in the paper "Photosynthetic Microalgae-Enhanced Oxygenation Amplifies Vascular Response to  Photodynamic Therapy in a  Chorioallantoic Membrane Model".

This readme file is a guide to understand the order of the folders of the CAM images. This data was used to construct the plot bars for Figures 3,4 and 5 of the paper: "Photosynthetic Microalgae-Enhanced Oxygenation Amplifies Vascular Response to Photodynamic Therapy in a Chorioallantoic Membrane Model"

The GitHub repository contains 11 folders. Each folder contains images of multiples eggs that were used to perform the vascularization measurements.
