# CAM_Biophotonics_Microalgae_2023
This is a repository of the raw photobleach data and the raw CAM images used for analysis in the paper "Photosynthetic Microalgae-Enhanced Oxygenation Amplifies Vascular Response to  Photodynamic Therapy in a  Chorioallantoic Membrane Model".


All the raw data used to construct Figures 1-5 are available. 

For the first part of the analysis this GitHub repository contains 7 folders. Each folder contains the raw spectroscopical data that was obtained for the photobleaching analysis.

For the second part of the analysis this GitHub repository contains 11 folders. Each folder contains images of multiples eggs that were used to perform the vascularization measurements.
