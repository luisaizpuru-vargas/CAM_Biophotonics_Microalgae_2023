# CAM_Biophotonics_Microalgae_2023
This is a repository of the raw CAM images used for analysis in the paper "Photosynthetic Microalgae-Enhanced Oxygenation Amplifies Vascular Response to  Photodynamic Therapy in a  Chorioallantoic Membrane Model".


All the raw files for the Figures 1-5 are available. 

For the second part of the analysis this GitHub repository contains 11 folders. Each folder contains images of multiples eggs that were used to perform the vascularization measurements.
